# flame_nano_rpg

A simple RPG game written in Dart on Flame engine.

## Intro

This project started as a way of learning Flame engine for a job interview.
However, the process of tinkering with it gives great pleasure to me, so now I'm slowly adding new features to it.

The idea is pretty much as old as it can be. Simple RPG game with enemies, missions, looting
and other stuff classic to this style of games.

I'm working on this project here and there when I have some free time and doing this purely for fun.

## Wishlist:

* [ ] Inventory and looting system
* [ ] Dialogs
* [ ] Missions
* [ ] Levels system with player progression
* [ ] Dynamic map generation based on seed value
* [ ] Proper pathfinding for NPC-s
* [ ] Sound design
